Running code:
Instructions for running as eclipse project:

First off, make sure that jdbc jar is in the build path of the project and that the database file is in the same directory as the source code. After you have the program running, navigating the interface is fairly easy.
The first drop down box is the bus stop that you wish to get on the bus. The second drop down box is which stop you wish to get off. If you only want to know buses that pick up a certain stop, you can leave
the second box its default value. Next, enter the day and time that you want to have the bus service(you must enter this and the starting route). After all your data is entered click the "View routes" button
to view all routes that service the given stops at the given time. You can double click any route in the list to view all stops that the given route services. Admins can login to edit any information in the
database(not currently functional).
